# Movie Recommendation System with Numpy, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System developed using Numpy, Pandas, and implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The system is designed to provide movie recommendations based on keywords such as cast, crew, genre, etc. The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies that are likely to be enjoyed by users with similar preferences.

## Installation

To run the Movie Recommendation System on your local machine, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the instructions and run the cells to load the data and generate movie recommendations.
3. Customize the input parameters (keywords, user preferences, etc.) as needed.

## Data

The system uses a movie dataset that includes information about movie titles, genres, cast, crew, and user ratings. The dataset is included in the `data` directory.

## Features

- **Keyword-Based Recommendations:** Users can input keywords related to cast, crew, genre, etc., and receive personalized movie recommendations.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** The recommendation engine utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences and behavior.

## How it Works

The system employs a collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies. It analyzes the similarities between users and items (movies) to make predictions about a user's preferences. The recommendation is based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.

## Examples

```python
# Example Usage
keywords = ['Tom Hanks', 'Drama', 'Steven Spielberg']
get_movie_recommendations(keywords)
```

This would return a list of recommended movies that involve Tom Hanks, fall under the Drama genre, and are directed by Steven Spielberg.
